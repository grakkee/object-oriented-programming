# ProgrammingAssignment7

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:  
1.  Continued use of **class** building skills.  
2.  Provide practice with new **SOLID design** skills.  
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For example, do not change the text from 
“Correct usage: ” to “correct”. 
Your assignment will be auto-graded and any changes in formatting will result in a loss in the grade.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.  

## Program
Create a game using the principles we've learned in class. Your project should demonstrate your understand of Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance. The project should also include a Composition relationship and an understand of Abstract Base Classes. Also, apply the SOLID design principles wherever appropriate.
- Your project should include the following files: 
- a driver 
- at least additional 4 classes
- a separate abstract base class

Your executable should be named ```adventure```
## Programming Problem
Creating a choose your own adventure becomes a coding choose your own adventure!

### The example executable:
An example executable is provided in this repository. You should be able to run it from your project folder.
If you encounter a “permission denied” error when attempting to run the executable, type ```chmod u+x adventureExecutable``` into the terminal and try running the executable again  

## Requirements
This program should allow for the creation of two different types of characters, players and orcs. Player and orc characters should have names, health points, and the capability to carry a sword. Player characters should also be able to carry shields. Both player and orc characters should be able to block and attack. 

Attacking has the potential to do certain amount of damage, which decreases health points. If the player has a shield, it should block (and therefore prevent) a certain amount of damage. If the player or orc character has a sword, they can parry which also blocks and prevents a certain amount of damage. 

Swords should have names and also the capacity to cause a certain amount of damage and parry a certain amount of damage. Shields should also have names and be able to prevent a certain amount of damage.

The game guides the player through a forest, where they happen upon certain adventures. In the end, they either vanquish the foe or die trying!

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “a descriptive message!”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.
