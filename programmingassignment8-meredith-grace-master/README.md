# ProgrammingAssignment8

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:  
1.  Continued use of **SOLID design**  skills.  
2.  Provide practice with new **Data Structures** skills.  
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For example, do not change the text from 
“Correct usage: ” to “correct”. 
Your assignment will be auto-graded and any changes in formatting will result in a loss in the grade.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.  

## Program
Extend the game you just created by adding an arsenal of swords!
- Your project should include the following files: 
- a driver 
- at least additional 4 classes
- a separate abstract base class
- a node class
- a list interface
- a linked list class  

Your executable should be named ```adventureList```
## Programming Problem
Creating a choose your own adventure becomes a coding choose your own adventure! 

## Requirements
This program should allow for the creation of two different types of characters, players and orcs. Player and orc characters should have names, health points, and the capability to carry a list of swords. Player characters should also be able to carry one shield. Both player and orc characters should be able to block and attack. 

Attacking has the potential to do certain amount of damage, which decreases health points. If the player has a shield, it should block (and therefore prevent) a certain amount of damage. If the player or orc character has a sword, they can parry which also blocks and prevents a certain amount of damage. 

Swords should have names and also the capacity to cause a certain amount of damage and parry a certain amount of damage. Shields should also have names and be able to prevent a certain amount of damage.

When the user picks up a new sword, they should be able to choose which from the list becomes their equipped sword.

The game guides the player through a forest, where they happen upon certain adventures. In the end, they either vanquish the foe or die trying!

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
