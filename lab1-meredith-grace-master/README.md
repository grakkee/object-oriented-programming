makefiles

This lab is designed to help you create your first makefile.

This repository contains the main driver, an empty source and an empty header file for a project. Your task is to pull the functions out of the main driver and put them into the appropriate source or header files and to create a makefile which compiles all the necessary pieces into an executable called anaylzer. That makefile should be uploaded to your repository when you're done, along with your changes to the other 3 files.
